# Usage

The following are some usage examples of how to use CIlib to define
a computational intelligence algorithm, and how to execute the declared
algorithm.

As with all algorithms, the usage is dependant on the problem goals and
the follow samples are provided to give the user a taste of how the definitions
are used only and do not limit the manner in which the library may be used.
